# Introduction to Python

In this section we will learn the basics of Python. We have prepared a notebook containing details, examples, and exercises about the following topics:

- What is Python?
- *Variables* – Types, declarations, and operations
- *Flow control* – Conditionals and loops
- Advanced objects – *Lists* and *dictionaries*
- Packing functionality – *Functions*

## What is Python?

Python is an **interpreted** programming language, which means that an _interpreter_ runs and executes your code line by line instead compiling it. Python has an elegant syntax that forces you to **indent your code to build code blocks**, so Python does not use `{ }` for code blocks. It is not common to use  semicolons in Python ( `;` ) at the end of any sentece. Another cool thing about Python is that you do not need to declare variables, you only define them, and it happens that Python is **dynamically typed**.
